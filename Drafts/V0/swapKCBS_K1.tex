\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Why self-testing}

Understanding the inner workings of quantum devices becomes challenging
and crucial as we scale quantum devices. The task of quantum device
certification is inherently challenging due to exponential scaling
of Hilbert space as system size increases. Moreover, in a faithfully
minimalistic scenario, developing trust in the internal functiong
of quantum device requires schemes One of the most potent methodologies
to render guarantees regarding the inner functioning of quantum devices
solely based on experimental statistics, under reasonable assumptions,
is self-testing. 

\subsection{State of the art}
\begin{itemize}
\item Bell/Device independence | Tensor structure
\begin{itemize}
\item Limitation: Difficult to enforce etc
\item Curve less robust to noise
\item Math is harder
\end{itemize}
\item Semi device independent
\begin{itemize}
\item Easier to implement
\item EPR steering {[}K{]}; almost like blind computing
\end{itemize}
\item All bipartite entangled states can be self-tested by quantum steering
| EPR steering
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Local Self testing }

Motivation: Device certification.
\begin{itemize}
\item Computation, which is usually local, it is inconvenient also less
secure to trust another party etc.
\end{itemize}
State of the art
\begin{itemize}
\item Vidick et al
\item Kishor's et al article on self-testing. Robustness curve was given
up to multiplicative constants. Not directly implementable. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contextuality}

Informal quick introduction

\subsubsection{Contribution}

Address limitations of Kishor et al's article
\begin{itemize}
\item theoretically obtained the robustness curve
\begin{itemize}
\item Moment matrices based approach
\item First robustness curve for a non-contextuality inequality (five cycles
no less!)
\end{itemize}
\item experimental demonstration of local self-testing
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assumptions and Memory leakage :P}

Self testing works under the following.

\subsubsection{Circumventing the memory assumption}
\begin{itemize}
\item Memory based
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum classical gap?
\end{itemize}
\item Dimensions based measures
\begin{itemize}
\item Quantum classical gap 
\item log{[}classical dimensions{]}=memory; quantum dimension = quantum
memory
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Criticism:

BQP$\subseteq$PSPACE; that's fine we hope to find the exact curve
to certify
\begin{itemize}
\item Poly separation or some such.
\end{itemize}

\section{Background}

\subsection{Exclusivity graph approach to contextuality}

\subsection{Robust self-testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item Definition
\item Statement for KCBS {[}PRL{]}
\item Robustness curve is missing! Or is it?
\end{itemize}


\section{Robustness Curve}

\subsection{Description}
\begin{itemize}
\item General description (explain importance)
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider any state and measurement system, which we henceforth call
a configuration, that is consistent with the observed data. A robustness
curve is a lower bound on the fidelity of any such configuration with
the ideal configuration. The curve is a relation between the fidelity
and the value of the KCBS expression.
\item More formally, this means $\text{min}\mathcal{F}\left(\left(\left|\psi^{\text{ideal}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{ideal}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}\right),\left(\left|\psi^{\text{cand}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{cand}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}\right)\right)$
subject to the constraint that $\left|\psi^{\text{cand}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{cand}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}$
satisfy the experimental statistics.
\item Fidelity= fidelity of state plus fidelity of measurement
\item Finding a lower-bound is non-trivial.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Overall Strategy {[}TODO: update later{]}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Regularizing the experimental statistics
\item Constructing the isometry
\item Deriving the expression for fidelity
\item Providing the lower bound
\end{itemize}
The goal is to provide a lower bound on fidelity for the experimental
results in section 2. The following steps are required:

\subsection{Regularizing the experimental statistics}

In reference \cite{Bharti2018}, authors assume that the measurement
operators follow cyclic compatibility structure. However, this need
not be true in the real life experimental scenario. Thus, the experimental
data may not belong to quantum set due to finite statistics and violation
of the cyclic compatibility structure. This demands a regularization
of the experimental data for the theoretical analysis. Here, regularization
means finding the statistics which is closest to our experimental
statistics and belongs to the quantum set. The set of quantum behaviours
forms a convex set, known as theta body. 

\subsection{Providing a lower bound on the fidelity from regularized measurement
statistics}

\subsubsection{Constructing the isometry}

A swap circuit between two qudit registers is given by $S=TUVU$ where

\[
T=\mathbb{I}\otimes\sum_{k}\vert-k\rangle\langle k\vert
\]

\[
U=\sum_{k=0}^{d-1}P^{k}\otimes\vert k\rangle\langle k\vert
\]

\[
V=\sum_{k=0}^{d-1}\vert k\rangle\langle k\vert\otimes P^{-k}
\]

and

\[
P=\sum_{k=0}^{d-1}\vert k+1\rangle\langle k\vert.
\]

Here, $P$ is a translation operator.

TUVU, Localizing matrix etc....

\subsubsection{Deriving the expression for fidelity}

Let $\left\{ \left\{ \bar{\Pi_{i}}\right\} _{i\in V},\vert\bar{\psi}\rangle\right\} $
be the ideal configuration and $\left\{ \left\{ \Pi_{i}\right\} ,\vert\psi\rangle\right\} $
be the candidate configuration. Our expression for the fidelity for
the aforementioned configurations is given by
\[
F\left(\alpha,\beta\right)=\alpha\sum_{i\in V}\langle\bar{\psi\vert}\bar{\Pi_{i}}\Pi_{i}\vert\psi\rangle+\beta\langle\bar{\psi\vert}\psi\rangle,
\]
where $\alpha$,$\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ and are weights on fidelitiy
for states and measured states respectively.

The total fidelity for state and projectors for odd $n$-cycle scenario
in the ideal case is $n+1.$

\subsubsection{Providing the lower bound on fidelity}
