\begin_layout Plain Layout
The self-testing results in reference
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 hinges on three assumptions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The measurements are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sharp
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Sharp measurements are outcome-repeatable and minimally disturbing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The measurements follow the compatibility relation according to an odd cycle
 graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The black box has no more memory than its information-carrying capacity.
 Each box is used once, and there is an unlimited supply of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the experiments, we verify sharpness (assumption 1) and compatibility
 (assumption 2) based on the techniques in reference
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "leupold2018sustained"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 To quantify sharpness of an observable 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

, it is instructive to quantify the probability of getting the same outcome
 corresponding to two consecutive measurements of the same measurement i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}.$
\end_inset

 The appropriate mathematical expression for the same could be given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{\mu}=\frac{\sum_{a_{1}}N\left(A_{\mu}=a_{1},A_{\mu}=a_{1}\right)}{N\left(A_{\mu},A_{\mu}\right)},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N(.)$
\end_inset

 quantifies the number of instances corresponding to the expression inside
 its following bracket.
 Coming back to assumption 2, the necessary conditions for compatibility
 are the absence of context-signalling as well as lack of influence of a
 precedding compatible measurement on the statistics of an observable.
 The forward context-signalling is quantified by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{u,v,w;i}^{f}=\frac{N_{i}\left(A_{\nu},A_{u}=a_{1}\right)}{N_{i}\left(A_{\nu},A_{u}\right)}-\frac{N_{i}\left(A_{w},A_{u}=a_{1}\right)}{N_{i}\left(A_{w},A_{u}\right)},\label{eq:SigF}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

whereas the backward context-signalling is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{u,v,w;i}^{b}=\frac{N_{i}\left(A_{u}=a_{1},A_{\nu}\right)}{N_{i}\left(A_{\nu},A_{u}\right)}-\frac{N_{i}\left(A=a_{1},A_{w}\right)}{N_{i}\left(A_{w},A_{u}\right)}.\label{eq:SigB}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is worth mentioning that the expressions for the forward and backward
 context-signalling are defined for some fixed input state 
\begin_inset Formula $i.$
\end_inset

 In case of no-context signalling, the value of both the expressions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is zero.
 Regarding assumption 3, we haven't closed the memory loop-hole.

Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset FormulaMacro

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the KCBS scenario, i.e.
 an experimental scenario which is specified by the events 
\begin_inset Formula $e_{1},e_{2}\dots e_{5}$
\end_inset

 whose exclusivity is given by a 
\begin_inset Formula $5$
\end_inset

-cycle exclusivity graph.
 Suppose we obtain the probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},p_{2}\dots p_{5}$
\end_inset

 experimentally (and ensure that they correspond to sharp measurements).
 We already saw that if these values nearly saturate the quantum bound for
 the KCBS non-contextuality inequality, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{5}p_{i}$
\end_inset

 approaches 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{5}\approx2.236\dots$
\end_inset

, then we know that all quantum realisations corresponding to the experimentally
 obtained probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

 are almost equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\text{KCBS}},\{\Pi_{i}^{\text{KCBS}}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

, up to a global isometry.
 To be more precise, consider any arbitrary quantum realisation given by
 a pure state 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 and rank one projectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\Pi_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{5}p_{i}=2+\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
 It was shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bharti2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that then, there exists an isometry 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left\Vert V\Pi_{i}V^{\dagger}-\Pi_{i}^{\KCBS}\right\Vert _{F}\le\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon})\label{eq:projKish}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in\{1,2\dots5\}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \rho-\rho^{{\rm KCBS}}\right\Vert _{F}\le\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\epsilon})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert A\right\Vert _{F}:={\rm tr}\left(\sqrt{A^{\dagger}A}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 [Verify this:] This result is stronger than the self-testing results which
 are usually stated for Bell non-locality, in the following sense.
 Typically, one is only able to make statements about the action of the
 projectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{i}$
\end_inset

 on the state 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 (see, for instance, ...).
 Despite this, without the constant hidden in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "eq:projKish"
plural "false"
caps "true"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, one cannot obtain a robustness curve and thus one cannot apply this in
 practice.
 In this work, we remedy this problem, taking inspiration from the Bell
 self-testing approach.
 To this end, we give a slightly different statement: we show that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{5}\mathcal{F}(V\Pi_{i}\rho\Pi_{i}V^{\dagger},\Pi_{i}^{\KCBS})+\mathcal{F}(V\rho V^{\dagger},\rho^{\KCBS})\ge f(\epsilon)\label{eq:lowerbound}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}(A,B):={\rm tr}\sqrt{\left|A^{1/2}B^{1/2}\right|}$
\end_inset

, we only require 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{i}$
\end_inset

 to be projectors and allow 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

 to be a mixed state.
 The advantage is that we are able to express 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\epsilon)$
\end_inset

 as a hierarchy of semi-definite programmes and compute lower bounds explicitly.
 While we state our result for the KCBS inequality, it readily extends to
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-cycle scenario.
 [TODO: if 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 cannot be shown to be independent of the individual 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

s, then we must skip it].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that while the result due to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bharti2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 only applies to rank one projectors and pure states, we can not make this
 assumption in our approach.
 This is because we are minimising over the set of all possible quantum
 realisations.
 But it is known that [VERIFY/GIVE AN ARGUMENT] for every quantum realisation,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho',\{\Pi_{i}'\}$
\end_inset

 one can find a quantum realisation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,\{\Pi_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{i}$
\end_inset

 are projectors (in a possibly larger space) which yields the same experimental
 outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Here, we wish to be more quantitative.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We want to know that given a certain value for 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{5}p_{i}$
\end_inset

, how close is every possible quantum realisation, given that it is consistent
 with the observed statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

, to 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\KCBS},\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\KCBS}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

.
 CLAIM (TODO: Kishor must check this): It turns out that this closeness
 depends only on the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{5}p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and not on the individual values 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

.
 The robustness curve, simply represents this closeness of quantum realisations
 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{5}p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We, in fact, satisfy ourselves with an upper bound on this measure of closeness.
 We now define the measure of closeness we use in this article.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As a measure of closeness between two quantum realisations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{A},\{\Pi_{i}^{A}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{B},\{\Pi_{i}^{B}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

, we use simply a sum of fidelities of the state and measurement settings,
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathcal{F}\left((\rho^{A},\{\Pi_{i}^{A}\}_{i=1}^{5}),(\rho^{B},\{\Pi_{i}^{B}\}_{i=1}^{5})\right):=\mathcal{F}\left(\rho^{A},\rho^{B}\right)+\sum_{i=1}^{5}\mathcal{F}(\Pi_{i}^{A}\rho^{A}\Pi_{i}^{A},\Pi_{i}^{B}\rho^{B}\Pi_{i}^{B}).
\]

\end_inset

Clearly, when both the states and the measurement settings are equal, the
 result is 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We now proceed more formally.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
General description (explain importance)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Consider any state and measurement system, which we henceforth call a configurat
ion, that is consistent with the observed data.
 A robustness curve is a lower bound on the fidelity of any such configuration
 with the ideal configuration.
 The curve is a relation between the fidelity and the value of the KCBS
 expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
More formally, this means 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{min}\mathcal{F}\left(\left(\left|\psi^{\text{ideal}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{ideal}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}\right),\left(\left|\psi^{\text{cand}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{cand}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 subject to the constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi^{\text{cand}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{cand}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

 satisfy the experimental statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Overall Strategy

\begin_layout Standard
We wish to lower bound the value of the following objective: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\min_{\rho,\{\Pi_{i}\}}\max_{V}\sum_{i=1}^{5}\mathcal{F}(V\Pi_{i}\rho\Pi_{i}V^{\dagger},\Pi_{i}^{\KCBS})+\mathcal{F}(V\rho V^{\dagger},\rho^{\KCBS})
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,\{\Pi_{i}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

 is a quantum realisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{p_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 (we know 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pi_{i}$
\end_inset

 are projectors), 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is an isometry mapping the space of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho,\{\Pi_{i}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

 to that of 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\KCBS},\{\Pi_{i}^{\KCBS}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the broadest level, the idea is to construct a particular isometry that
 is intended to map a given quantum realisation into a realisation close
 to the standard quantum realisation 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho^{\KCBS},\{\Pi_{i}^{\KCBS}\}_{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

.
 Note to establish a lower bound on the fidelities, it suffices to show
 the existence of one global isometry (for each quantum realisation).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, authors assume that the measurement operators follow cyclic compatibility
 structure.
 However, this need not be true in the real life experimental scenario.
 Thus, the experimental data may not belong to quantum set due to finite
 statistics and violation of the cyclic compatibility structure.
 This demands a regularization of the experimental data for the theoretical
 analysis.
 Here, regularization means finding the statistics which is closest to our
 experimental statistics and belongs to the quantum set.
 The set of quantum behaviours forms a convex set, known as theta body.
