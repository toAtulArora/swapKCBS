\begin_layout Subsection
Why self-testing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding the inner workings of quantum devices becomes challenging
 and crucial with the increase in their corresponding dimensionality.
 The task of quantum device certification is inherently challenging due
 to the exponential scaling of Hilbert space as system size increases.
 In a faithfully minimalistic scenario, developing trust in the internal
 functioning of quantum devices requires certification schemes that require
 minimal assumptions about their functioning.
 One of the most potent methodologies to render guarantees regarding the
 inner functioning of quantum devices solely based on experimental statistics,
 under reasonable assumptions, is self-testing.
 The first self-testing protocol was developed in the milestone paper by
 Mayers and Yao in 2004, which relied on Bell nonlocality.
 Since then, self-testing via Bell nonlocality have been demonstrated for
 GHZ states, all pure bipartite entangles states and all multipartite entangled
 states that admit a Schmidt decomposition.
 Self-testing via Bell nonlocality is also known as device independent self
 testing as it can be seen as black-box certification of quantum systems.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 hinges on three assumptions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The measurements are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sharp
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Sharp measurements are outcome-repeatable and minimally disturbing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The measurements follow the compatibility relation according to an odd cycle
 graph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The black box has no more memory than its information-carrying capacity.
 Each box is used once, and there is an unlimited supply of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the experiments, we verify sharpness (assumption 1) and compatibility
 (assumption 2) based on the techniques in reference
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "leupold2018sustained"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 To quantify sharpness of an observable 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}$
\end_inset

, it is instructive to quantify the probability of getting the same outcome
 corresponding to two consecutive measurements of the same measurement i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\mu}.$
\end_inset

 The appropriate mathematical expression for the same could be given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R_{\mu}=\frac{\sum_{a_{1}}N\left(A_{\mu}=a_{1},A_{\mu}=a_{1}\right)}{N\left(A_{\mu},A_{\mu}\right)},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N(.)$
\end_inset

 quantifies the number of instances corresponding to the expression inside
 its following bracket.
 Coming back to assumption 2, the necessary conditions for compatibility
 are the absence of context-signalling as well as lack of influence of a
 precedding compatible measurement on the statistics of an observable.
 The forward context-signalling is quantified by
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{u,v,w;i}^{f}=\frac{N_{i}\left(A_{\nu},A_{u}=a_{1}\right)}{N_{i}\left(A_{\nu},A_{u}\right)}-\frac{N_{i}\left(A_{w},A_{u}=a_{1}\right)}{N_{i}\left(A_{w},A_{u}\right)},\label{eq:SigF}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

whereas the backward context-signalling is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
S_{u,v,w;i}^{b}=\frac{N_{i}\left(A_{u}=a_{1},A_{\nu}\right)}{N_{i}\left(A_{\nu},A_{u}\right)}-\frac{N_{i}\left(A=a_{1},A_{w}\right)}{N_{i}\left(A_{w},A_{u}\right)}.\label{eq:SigB}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is worth mentioning that the expressions for the forward and backward
 context-signalling are defined for some fixed input state 
\begin_inset Formula $i.$
\end_inset

 In case of no-context signalling, the value of both the expressions 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and

 is zero.
 Regarding assumption 3, we haven't closed the memory loop-hole.

General description (explain importance)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Consider any state and measurement system, which we henceforth call a configurat
ion, that is consistent with the observed data.
 A robustness curve is a lower bound on the fidelity of any such configuration
 with the ideal configuration.
 The curve is a relation between the fidelity and the value of the KCBS
 expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
More formally, this means 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{min}\mathcal{F}\left(\left(\left|\psi^{\text{ideal}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{ideal}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}\right),\left(\left|\psi^{\text{cand}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{cand}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}\right)\right)$
\end_inset

 subject to the constraint that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\psi^{\text{cand}}\right\rangle ,\left\{ \Pi_{i}^{\text{cand}}\right\} _{i=1}^{5}$
\end_inset

 satisfy the experimental statistics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fidelity= fidelity of state plus fidelity of measurement

\begin_layout Standard
The goal is to provide a lower bound on fidelity for the experimental results
 in section 2.
 The following steps are required:

Regularizing the experimental statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Bharti2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, authors assume that the measurement operators follow cyclic compatibility
 structure.
 However, this need not be true in the real life experimental scenario.
 Thus, the experimental data may not belong to quantum set due to finite
 statistics and violation of the cyclic compatibility structure.
 This demands a regularization of the experimental data for the theoretical
 analysis.
 Here, regularization means finding the statistics which is closest to our
 experimental statistics and belongs to the quantum set.
 The set of quantum behaviours forms a convex set, known as theta body.

 Our expression for the fidelity for the aforementioned configurations is
