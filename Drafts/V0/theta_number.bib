  title       = {Deriving Tight Bell Inequalities for 2 Parties with Many 2-valued Observables from Facets of Cut Polytopes},
  abstract    = {Relatively few families of Bell inequalities have previously been identified. Some examples are the trivial, CHSH, I_{mm22}, and CGLMP inequalities. This paper presents a large number of new families of tight Bell inequalities for the case of many observables. For example, 44,368,793 inequivalent tight Bell inequalities other than CHSH are obtained for the case of 2 parties each with 10 2-valued observables. This is accomplished by first establishing a relationship between the Bell inequalities and the facets of the cut polytope, a well studied object in polyhedral combinatorics. We then prove a theorem allowing us to derive new facets of cut polytopes from facets of smaller polytopes by a process derived from Fourier-Motzkin elimination, which we call triangular elimination. These new facets in turn give new tight Bell inequalities. We give additional results for projections, liftings, and the complexity of membership testing for the associated Bell polytope.},

  abstract    = {We construct a non-contextual hidden variable model consistent with all the kinematic predictions of quantum mechanics (QM). The famous Bell-KS theorem shows that non-contextual models which satisfy a further reasonable restriction are inconsistent with QM. In our construction, we define a weaker variant of this restriction which captures its essence while still allowing a non-contextual description of QM. This is in contrast to the contextual hidden variable toy models, such as the one by Bell, and brings out an interesting alternate way of looking at QM. The results also relate to the Bohmian model, where it is harder to pin down such features.},

  abstract    = {Self-testing unknown quantum states and measurements is a fundamental problem in quantum information processing. Here, we introduce an approach for studying this problem via the use of noncontextuality inequalities. We show that the celebrated Klyachko-Can-Binicio\ifmmode \breve{g}\else \u{g}\fi{}lu-Shumovsky test and its generalization to contextuality scenarios with odd n-cycle compatibility graphs admit self-testing. Furthermore, we show that these results are robust subject to the appropriate compatibility assumptions, demonstrating the use of contextuality for self-testing applications. We arrive at our results using the graph-theoretic framework for contextuality introduced by Cabello, Severini, and Winter, combined with various techniques from semidefinite programming. Our result opens many interesting questions for future research.},

  abstract     = {We introduce a notion of contextuality for transformations in sequential contexts, distinct from the Bell-Kochen-Specker and Spekkens notions of contextuality. Within a transformation-based model for quantum computation we show that strong sequential-transformation contextuality is necessary and sufficient for deterministic computation of non-linear functions if classical components are restricted to mod2-linearity and matching constraints apply to any underlying ontology. For probabilistic computation, sequential-transformation contextuality is necessary and sufficient for advantage in this task and the degree of advantage quantifiably relates to the degree of contextuality.},

  abstract    = {The connection between contextuality and graph theory has led to many developments in the field. In particular, the sets of probability distributions in many contextuality scenarios can be described using well known convex sets from graph theory, leading to a beautiful geometric characterization of such sets. This geometry can also be explored in the definition of contextuality quantifiers based on geometric distances, which is important for the resource theory of contextuality, developed after the recognition of contextuality as a potential resource for quantum computation. In this paper we review the geometric aspects of contextuality and use it to define several quantifiers, which have the advantage of being applicable to the exclusivity approach to contextuality, where previously defined quantifiers do not fit.},
