# Numerics for Self-Testing of a Single Quantum System: Theory and Experiment

This folder contains the numerics for arXiv:xxx.xxx. 

Feel free to contact us for any details.

* [All\ data](All\ data): Contains the experimental data.
* [Configuration](Configuration): KCBS configuration: optimal and sub-optimal. How close is a given configuration (in three dimensions) is to an ideal configuration, determined up to a unitary. This is done by parametrising unitaries in 3 dimension with eight parameters.
* [Repeatibility](A jupyter notebook which computes the repeatability of each measurement and the associated results.)
